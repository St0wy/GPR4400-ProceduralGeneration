# GPR4400-ProceduralGeneration

This repository contains exercise I did to learn procedural generation.

## Terrain generation

The terrain generation can be seen in the "TerrainGeneration" scene.

All the code executes in edit mode. You can try it in the "Generator" game object. You can then control the generation in the inspector, and start it with the "Regenerate" button at the top.
